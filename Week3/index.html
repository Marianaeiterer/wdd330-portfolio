    </ul>

    <h3>Notes about the "this" keyword:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A function that is a property of an object is called its method<br>
            Examples: <br>
            user.sayHi = function() {<br>
            alert("Hello!");<br>
            };<br>
            user.sayHi(); // Hello!<br>
            <br>
            Another way is: <br>
            // first, declare <br>
            function sayHi() { <br>
            alert("Hello!"); <br>
            } <br>
            // then add as a method <br>
            user.sayHi = sayHi;<br>

            user.sayHi(); // Hello!<br>
        </li>
        <li>We can use a shorter syntax for the methods<br>
            Examples:<br>
            // these objects do the same<br>
            user = {<br>
            sayHi: function() {<br>
            alert("Hello");<br>
            }<br>
            };<br>
            <br>
            // method shorthand looks better, right?<br>
            user = {<br>
            sayHi() { // same as "sayHi: function(){...}"<br>
            alert("Hello");<br>
            }<br>
            };<br>
        </li>
        <li>Methods allow object to act like object.doSomething()</li>
        <li>If we need to access something stored in the object we can use the keyword "this"</li>
        <li>To access the object, a method can use the "this" keyword.<br>
            Examples:<br>
            let user = {<br>
            name: "John",<br>
            age: 30,<br>

            sayHi() {<br>
            // "this" is the "current object"<br>
            alert(this.name);<br>
            }<br>
            };<br>

            user.sayHi(); // John
        </li>
        <li>We can also use the name of the object, but if we copy user to another variable and overwrite user, the code
            won't work. Use "this" prevents those mistakes.</li>
        <li>“this” can be used in any function, even if it's not a method of an object</li>
        <li>In JavaScript this is “free”, its value is evaluated at call-time and does not depend on where the method
            was declared, but rather on what object is “before the dot”.</li>
        <li>A positive thing about this is that a function can be reused for different objects, but this flexibility
            creates more possibilities for mistakes. </li>
        <li>Arrow functions are special: they don't have their “own” this. When this is accessed inside an arrow
            function, it is taken from outside.</li>
        <li>Six different ways where this can take on new values:
            <ol>
                <li>"this" in global context - Outside of any function, the default for "this" is the window object</li>
                <li>"this" in object construction - When you create a new instance of an object with the "new" keyword,
                    "this" refers to the instance. </li>
                <li>"this" in an object method - Refers to the object itself</li>
                <li>"this" in a simple function - "this" is always set to Window in a simple function.</li>
                <li>"this" in an arrow function - "this" in an arrow function is always the same as "this" around it. If
                    we use arrow functions within an object method, the "this" context stays as the object, not Window.
                </li>
                <li>"this" in an event listener - "this" is set to the element that fired the event in an event listener
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Notes from Chapter 5: Objects</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Objects have properties that can be any JavaScript value. If it's a function, it's known as a method.<br>
            Example of an object literal:<br>
            const superman = {<br>
            name: 'Superman',<br>
            'real name': 'Clark Kent',<br>
            height: 75,<br>
            weight: 235,<br>
            hero: true,<br>
            villain: false,<br>
            allies: ['Batman','Supergirl','Superboy'],<br>
            fly() {<br>
            return 'Up, up and away!';<br>
            }<br>
            };
        </li>
        <li>All objects can change any time when a program is running, even if it was declared using const.</li>
        <li>The objects can inherit properties from another object, and all objects have the hasOwnProperty() method.
        </li>
        <li>To add a new property to an object we simply assign a value to the new property<br>
            Example: <br>
            superman.city = 'Metropolis'; <br>
            &lt&lt 'Metropolis'
        </li>
        <li>To change the value of an object's property we use assign. <br>
            Example:<br>
            superman['real name'] = 'Kal-El';<br>
            &lt&lt 'Kal-El'
        </li>
        <li>Any property can be removed from an object, we use the delete operator<br>
            Example:<br>
            delete superman.fly <br>
            &lt&lt true
        </li>
        <li>Nested Objects are objects that contain other objects. </li>
        <li>Objects are copied by reference, if we create an object that is a copy of another object, both will point to
            the same object in memory, so if we change the property in one, it will automatically change in the other,
            because they refer to the same object. </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Built-in Objects:</h4>
        </li>
        <li>JavaScript has a number of built-in projects that can be accessed in any part of the program. They provide
            useful properties and methods. </li>
        <li>JSON: is a string representation of the object literal notation that we have just seen.</li>
        <li>JSON methods:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The parse() method transforms a JSON string of data into a JavaScript object</li>
            <li>The stringify() method transforms a JavaScript object into a JSON string data</li>
            <li>The methods inside objects are ignored by the stringify()</li>
        </ul>
        <li>The Math Object is an object that has several properties that represent mathematical constants and methods
            of mathematical operations</li>
        <li>Date Object contains information about dates and times </li>
        <li>RegExp Object a regular expression is a pattern that can be used to search strings that match the pattern.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Notes from Chapter 6: The Document Object Model</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The Document Object Model (DOM): represents an HTML document as a network of connected nodes.</li>
        <li>We can use JavaScript to access and modify parts of a web page using the built-in object called document.
        </li>
        <li>The DOM provides several methods that allow us to access any element on a page. These methods will return an
            object or a note list. </li>
        <li>Shortcut Methods:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Document.body - returns the body element of a web page</li>
            <li>Document.images - returns a node list of all the images</li>
            <li>Document.links - returns a node list of all the &lta> elements and &ltarea> elements with an href
                attribute</li>
            <li>Document.anchors - returns a node list of all the &lta> elements with a name attribute</li>
            <li>Document.forms- returns a node list of all the forms.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Node lists are array-like objects but are not arrays. They can be transformed into an array using
            Array.from() method.</li>
        <li>getAttribute() - returns the value of the attribute provided as an argument.</li>
        <li>setAttribute() - can change the value of an element's attributes. It takes two arguments: the attribute that
            you wish to change and the new value of that attribute. If an element does not have an attribute, it can add
            it to the element.<br>
            Example:<br>
            We want to change the class of the element in the wonderWomen variable to 'villain', we could do so using
            this code: <br>
            wonderWoman.setAttribute('class', 'villain');<br>
            &lt&lt undefined<br>

            wonderWoman.getAttribute('class');<br>
            &lt&lt "villain"<br>
        </li>
        <li>The remove method will remove a specific class from an element. </li>
        <li>The toggle method will add a class if an element doesn't have the class and remove the class if the element
            already has it. </li>
        <li>The contains method will check to see if the element has a particular class.</li>
        <li>The innerHTML element property returns all the child elements of an element as a string of HTML. If an
            element contains lots of other elements, all the raw HTML is returned. It can also be used to place a chunk
            of HTML inside an element. Also, if we want to insert a large amount of HTML into the document, we can use
            it to insert the raw HTML as a string instead of creating each element. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Notes from Chapter 7: Events</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Every time the user interacts with a webpage an event occurs and the program can respond to. </li>
        <li>Event listeners let the program know that the event happened then the program can respond to it. <br>
            Example of event listener for when the user clicks anywhere in the page:<br>
            document.body.addEventListener("click", doSomething);
        </li>
        <li>The addEventListener() method is the recommended way to deal with events <br>
            Example:<br>
            document.body.addEventListener('click',doSomething);<br>

            The first parameter is the type of event<br>
            The second parameter is a callback function that is invoked when the event occurs.
        </li>
        <li>Some types of events:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Click</li>
            <li>Mousedown</li>
            <li> Mouseup</li>
            <li>Dblclick, double click</li>
            <li>Mouseover - occurs when the mouse pointer is placed over the element</li>
            <li>Mouseout - occurs when the mouser point moves away from an element. </li>
            <li>Mousemove - occurs whenever the mouse moves, while the cursor is placed in the element applied. </li>
            <li>Keydown - occurs when a key is pressed and continue if the key is held down</li>
            <li>Keypress - after the keydown and before the keyup. Only occurs for keys that produce character input.
                This means that it's the most reliable way to find out the character that was pressed on the keyboard.
            </li>
            <li>Keyup - occurs when a key is released. </li>
        </ul>
        <li> removeEventListener() method can remover an event listener</li>
        <li>preventDefault() method prevents the default behavior. Be careful when using it. </li>
        <li>Event Propagation is the order that the events fire on each element. When you click on an element, you are
            actually clicking on all the elements nested inside of it. </li>
        <li>Bubbling: The event fires on the element clicked first, and then bubbles up firing an event on each parent
            element until the root. </li>
        <li>Capturing: fires an event on the root element first and then propagates downwards, firing an event on each
            child element until it reaches the target element that was clicked on. It happen adding the third parameter to the addEventListener() method.<br>
            Example: <br>
            ulElement.addEventListener('click', (event) =><br>
            console.log('Clicked on ul'),true);<br>

            liElement.addEventListener('click', (event) =><br>
            console.log('Clicked on li'),true);<br>
        </li>
        <li>Event Delegation: used to attach an event listener to a parent element in order to capture events that are triggered by its child elements.<br>
            Example:<br>
            &ltul id='list'><br>
            &ltli>one&lt/li><br>
            &ltli>two&lt/li><br>
            &ltli>three&lt/li><br>
            &lt/ul><br>
            ulElement.addEventListener('click',highlight);<br>
            Now clicking on any list item will highlight that list item as if it was the target of the click event.
        </li>

    </ul>
