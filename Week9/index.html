    <h3>Notes from Chapter 9: The Window Object:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Every environment in JavaScript has a global object. In a browser the global object is the window object.
        </li>
        <li> The Browser Object Model (or BOM for short) is a collection of properties and methods that contain
            information about the browser and computer screen. </li>
        <li>A way of assigning the variable global to the global object: <br>
            Example: <br>
            // from within the global scope <br>
            const global = this;
        </li>
        <li>Global variables can be accessed in all parts of the program. Global variables are actual properties of a
            global object.<br>
            Example:<br>
            x = 6; // global variable created<br>
            &lt&lt 6<br>

            window.x // same variable can be accessed as a property of the window object<br>
            &lt&lt 6<br>

            // both variables are exactly the same<br>
            window.x === x;<br>
            &lt&lt true
        </li>
        <li>Some functions we've already met, such as parseInt() and isNaN(), are actually methods of the global object,
            which in a browser environment makes them methods of the window object</li>
        <li>The window object has properties and methods that provide information about the user's browser. </li>
        <li>The window.location property is an object that contains information about the URL of the current page. It
            contains a number of properties that provide information about different fragments of the URL.</li>
        <li>Some properties:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>href property returns the full URL <br>
                Example:<br>
                window.location.href <br>
                &lt&lt https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/javascript-novice-to-ninja </li>
            <li>protocol property returns a string of the protocol being used</li>
            <li>host return a string of the domain of the current URL and port number</li>
            <li>hotname returns a string of the domain of the current URL</li>
            <li>pathname returns a string of the path that follows the domain </li>
        </ul>
        <li>windon.open() method is used to open a new window. The first parameter is the URL, the second is the window
            title and the third is a list of attributes. <br>
            Example:<br>
            const popup = window.open('https://sitepoint.com','SitePoint','width=400,height=400,resizable=yes');
        </li>
        <li>The window.screen object contains information about the screen the browser is displayed on.</li>
        <li>To find the height and width of the screen in pixels we use: <br>
            window.screen.height <br>
            &lt&lt 1024 <br>

            window.screen.width <br>
            &lt&lt 1280 <br>
        </li>
        <li>The availHeight and availWidth can be used to find the height and width of the screen, excluding any
            operating system menus. <br>
            Example:<br>
            window.screen.availWidth <br>
            &lt&lt 1280 <br>
            window.screen.availHeight <br>
            &lt&lt 995 </li>
        <li>The screen object is more useful in mobile devices. </li>
        <li>Each window object contains a document object. This object has properties and methods that deal with the
            page that has been loaded into the window.</li>
        <li>Cookies are small files that are saved locally on a user's computer. This is a way of storing information
            that can be retrieved between requests. </li>
        <li>A restriction of cookies is that they can only be read by a web page from the same domain that set them.
            This is to stop sites being able to access information about users, such as other sites they have visited.
        </li>
        <li>Creating a Cookie: <br>
            Example:<br>
            document.cookie = 'name=Superman'; <br>
            &lt&lt "name=Superman"
        </li>
        <li>To append a new cookie, we just need to assign another cookie. It won't overwrite the last one, it will just
            append it. <br>
            Example: <br>
            document.cookie = 'hero=true'; <br>
            &lt&lt "hero=true" <br>
            document.cookie='city=Metropolis' ; <br>
            &lt&lt "city=Metropolis" </li>
        <li>A cookie's value can be changed by reassigning it to document.cookie using the same name but a different
            value. </li>
        <li>document.cookie allow us to see the current contents of a cookie jar</li>
        <li>The window.setTimeout() method accepts a callback to a function as its first parameter and a number of
            milliseconds as its second parameter. </li>
        <li>This method returns an integer which is an ID used to reference to that particular method. </li>
        <li>It can also cancel the timeout using the window.clearTimeout() method.<br>
            Example:<br>
            window.clearTimeout(5);<br>
            &lt&lt undefined
        </li>
        <li>The window.setInterval() method will repeatedly invoke the callback function after every given number of
            milliseconds. <br>
            Example:<br>
            function chant(){ console.log('Beetlejuice'); }<br>
            const summon = window.setInterval(chant,1000);<br>
            &lt&lt 6 </li>
        <li>This will show the message “Beetlejuice” in the console every second (1,000 milliseconds).</li>
        <li>To stop it, we use: window.clearInterval() method and the variable repeat as an argument<br>
            Example:<br>
            window.clearInterval(summon);
        </li>
        <li>The setTimeOut() and setInterval() methods can be used to animate elements on a web page.</li>
        <li>This was the only way to achieve animation using JavaScript until the window.requestAnimationFrame() method
            was developed.</li>
        <li>This method works similar to the window. setInterval() method, but it has a number of improvements. </li>
        <li> Some improvements are making the most of the browser's built-in graphics-handling capabilities, and not
            running
            the animation when the tab is inactive, resulting in a much smoother performance.</li>
        <li>Example of Animation using setInterval() and requestAnimationFrame() methods: <a target="_blank"
                href="exercise.html">Example</a></li>
        <li>We notice that the first square using setInterval() is slower than the second square using the
            requestAnimationFrame() method. </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Notes from Chapter 14: HTML5 APIs:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The "data-" attribute is a way of embedding data in a web page using custom attributes that are ignored by
            the browser</li>
        <li>The names of these attributes can be decided by the developer, but they must use the following format:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Start with "data-".</li>
            <li>Contain only lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, dots, colons or underscores.</li>
            <li>Include an optional string value.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Examples: <br>
            data-powers = 'flight superSpeed'<br>
            data-rating = '5' <br>
            data-dropdown <br>
            data-user = 'DAZ' <br>
            data-max-length = '32'
        </li>
        <li>Each element has a dataset property that can be used to access any data- attributes it contains.<br>
            Example:<br>
            &ltdiv id='hero' data-powers='flight superSpeed'><br>
            Superman<br>
            &lt/div><br>
            const superman = document.getElementById('hero');<br>
            const powers = superman.dataset.powers;<br>
            &lt&lt 'flight superSpeed' </li>
        <li>The HTML5 specification contains a number of APIs that help to gain access to hardware, such as cameras,
            batteries, geolocation, and the graphics card.</li>
        <li>
            <h4>HTML5 Web Storage</h4>
        </li>
        <li>The Web Storage API provides a key-value store on the client's computer that is similar to using cookies but
            has fewer restrictions, more storage capacity, and is generally easier to use. </li>
        <li>The Web Storage API has some crucial differences with cookies:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Information stored is not shared with the server on every request.</li>
            <li>Information is available in multiple windows of the browser (but only if the domain is the same).</li>
            <li>Storage capacity limit is much larger than the 4KB limit for cookies </li>
            <li>Any data stored does not automatically expire as it does with cookies. This potentially makes cookies a
                better choice for something like showing a popup once a day.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>If a browser supports the Web Storage API, the window object will have a property called localStorage, which
            is a native object with a number of properties and methods used to store data. <br>
            localStorage.setItem('name', 'Walter White'); // saves a value locally<br>
            localStorage.getItem('name');<br>
            &lt&lt "Walter White" // get the value stored in the name </li>
        <li>Rather than using the getItem() and setItem() methods, assignment can be used instead.<br>
            localStorage.name = 'Heisenberg'; <br>

            console.log(localStorage.name); <br>
            &lt&lt "Heisenberg";<br>
            localStorage.removeItem('name'); // removes an entry from local storage<br>
            delete localStorage.name; // we also can remove something using the delete operator<br>
            localStorage.clear(); // completely removes everything stored in local storage
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Geolocation</h4>
        </li>
        <li>The Geolocation API is used to obtain the geographical position of the device.</li>
        <li>This means it can be used to find the user's exact location, then link to nearby places or measure the speed
            at which the user is moving. </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Web Workers</h4>
        </li>
        <li>JavaScript is a single-threaded language, meaning that only one process can run at one time. Web workers
            allow processes to be run in the background, adding support for concurrency in JavaScript <br>
            Example:<br>
            const worker = new Worker('task.js');
        </li>
        <li>This function takes the name of another JavaScript file as an argument. </li>
        <li>If this file exists, it will be downloaded asynchronously. The worker will only start when the file has
            finished downloading. </li>
        <li>If the file doesn't exist, an error is thrown.</li>
        <li>When a worker has completed its task, it can be stopped using the terminate() method from within the main
            script or from inside the worker script.<br>
            worker.terminate(); //from the main script<br>
            self.close(); //from the worker script
        </li>
        <li>Example of worker being used to calculate the factors of a number: <a target="_blank" href="factors.html">Example</a></li>
        <li>Without the worker, if the number was too large the page would freeze and we wouldn't be able to do anything
            else, like change the background while waiting the answer. Using worker though, allows us to calculate the
            factors without freeze the page. </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Websockets</h4>
        </li>
        <li>Websocket is a new protocol that allows two-way communication with a server - also known as push messaging.
            This means that a connection is kept open and responses are 'pushed' to the client as soon as they are
            received.</li>
        <li>Example of using a Websocket: <a target="_blank" href="websocket.html">Example</a></li>
        <li>
            <h4>Notifications</h4>
        </li>
        <li>The Notification API allows you to show messages using the system's notifications. This is usually a popup
            in the corner of the screen, but it changes depending on the operating system. </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Multimedia</h4>
        </li>
        <li>HTML5 introduced the &ltaudio> and &ltvideo> tags used to insert audio and video clips into a web page. It
            also introduced a Media API for controlling the playback of the clips using JavaScript. <br>
            Example of adding a video: <br>
            &ltvideo src='http://movie.mp4' controls> <br>
            Your browser does not support the video element. <br>
            &lt/video>
        </li>
        <li>The content inside the audio and video tags will only display if the browser does not support them. </li>
        <li>The controls attribute can be added without any value and will display the browser's native controls, such
            as play, pause, and volume control.</li>
        <li>Audio and video elements have a number of properties and methods to control the playback of the clip. Some
            of them are:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>play() method will start the clip playing from its current position </li>
            <li>pause() method will pause the clip at its current position </li>
            <li>volume property is a number that can be used to set the audio volume </li>
            <li>muted property is a boolean value that can be used to mute the audio </li>
            <li>currentTime property is a number value that can be used to jump to another part of the clip </li>
            <li>playbackRate property is used to fast-forward or rewind the clip by changing its value. </li>
            <li>loop property is a boolean value that can be set to true to make the clip repeat in a loop </li>
            <li>duration property can be used to see how long the clip lasts </li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
